@loevgaard could you add `tests/Application/public/media/image/.gitignore` file and remove that line in Travis? It would make it passing also when run manually, not only on Travis CI.

Okay, you already did that. Apparently my test plugin wasn't updated and then I saw this line in travis and figured it must be a bug. Now I just removed the line from travis :)
