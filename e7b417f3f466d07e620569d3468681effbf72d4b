Seems like a fair solution üëç Could you also remove [this line](https://github.com/Sylius/PluginSkeleton/blob/1.2/.travis.yml#L29) from Travis configuration? And I believe it should be opened to branch `1.2` :) Could you please rebase it?

Ok, seems that it won't be so easy, as I thought and we should probably incorporate these changes to `1.2` and `1.3` separately :)

Yes I tested it on 1.3 only. I‚Äôll remove that line tomorrow morning.

Hi @Zales0123,
since this PR is on `1.3` there is no line to remove on the `.travis.yml` file so I think it can be merged.
Do you want me to create a separate PR for the `1.2` branch with the same change in the `.gitignore` and the `mkdir` removal in the `.travis.yml`?
